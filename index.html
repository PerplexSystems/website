  <h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Welcome to Perplex Systems, where we humbly embrace the journey of
enlightenment in software craftsmanship and its tenets. &ldquo;I have been
perplex, just like you,&rdquo; echoes our shared experience, as we navigate
the depths of the lost arts of abstraction.</p>
<p>As guardians of forgotten arts, we recognize the transformative
potential of rediscovery. Our industry has long lost its avant-garde
meta-history it once had, and we can now only draw inspiration from
what we delicately weave in the present.</p>
<p>Within our enigmatic collective, we cherish the wisdom of antiquity,
blending it with modern ingenuity to forge paths once thought
lost. With reverence for the past and a keen eye on the future, we
sculpt software solutions that stand as monuments to our collective
journey.</p>
<p>In the pursuit of excellence, collaboration reigns supreme. Through
the synergy of diverse minds and perspectives, we unearth hidden
treasures of knowledge, breathing new life into forgotten paradigms
and shaping a brighter tomorrow.</p>
<p>Join Perplex Systems on a voyage of rediscovery, where the power of
sound abstractions echo with the promise of sophistication. Together,
let us embrace humility as we put forth enduring wisdom.</p>
