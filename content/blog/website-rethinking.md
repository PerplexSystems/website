Since the inception of Perplex Systems© our website wandered the
digital space in a solid but confused outfit. Rocking a black t-shirt
with blue denim pants. Sometimes even risking a white t-shirt. It's a
clean outfit, timeless and... souless. It might have dressed skinny
ripped jeans and chunky shoes once, but not even the comically large
foam of its shoe's sole held down the image to be emphasize.

Somehow, clarity struck us and it's done looking neutral. It is the
cuffed brown trousers with orthopedic leather dress shoes.
**Unapologetically corporate**. Reliable. You might not notice it
at first, but it's around. Its steps are nearly silent on the carpet
tiles, muted by quarterly goals and irrelevant KPIs. Awkward laughs
are getting louder, the expresso aroma invades your personal space.

By the time you turn your head, another "*reorg*" is announced.
Departments are rearranged. Teams dissolve. The flooring is now
composed of Terrazzo tiles. Someone messages you: "Let's take this
offline.".

It bears no voice or control over this ritual. It observes you packing
as many before.
